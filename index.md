### Greyscript
Greyscript is a super cool and extensive hacking tool. Greysploit is available for **free** on the apt repository `1.219.247.32`, or on BTCshop for 1 BTC.
#### Cool Features
- Cloud Computing

  Greysploit has the *optional* ability to scan libraries and decipher hashes remotely. This allows you to perform otherwise slow actions much quicker, regardless of the hardware on your current system. This is particularly helpful when hacking routers.
- Streamer Mode

  Greysploit has a streamer mode, available with `greysploit -ss`. With streamer mode enabled, various sensitive information (including Public IPs) is hidden with a magenta highlight, which can be blocked with a magenta chroma key. For OBS, I find a similarity of **375** works well. You can also type HIDE and certain inputs to hide whatever you type behind the magenta highlight.
- Email Inputs

  If you enter your E-Mail address and password in the `setup` menu, Greysploit has the ability to automatically pull IP addresses from your E-mails. For example, on the home menu, if you enter `M#1` or `M#3`, it would look for any IP addresses in your 1st most recent E-mail, or your 3rd most recent E-mail.
- Frequent Updates

  Greysploit is frequently updated, and actively maintained. If you want to see the new and upcoming features, use the `greysploitExp` version on the apt repository, or use the `update exp` command.
